<h2>Thoughts about WebAssembly outside-the-browser, inside-the-desktop</h2>

<p>
  Some reflections about
  <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>,
  the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a>
  and desktop application development.
</p>
<p>
  To know more about the Bytecode Alliance (WebAssembly outside-the-browser),
  you can read
  <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/11/announcing-the-bytecode-alliance/">this nice article by Mozilla</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Note that I don't plan to work on this, it's just some thoughts about what
  could the future bring us. If someone is interested, this would be a really,
  <em>really</em> nice project that would totally change the landscape of
  native desktop application development. I'm convinced that the solution isn't
  Rust or C++, or C# or Java, or whichever new language will appear in 20 years
  that will make Rust obsolete; the solution is some piece of infrastructure
  such as <strong>nanoprocesses</strong>.
</p>

<h3>GNOME, C/GObject and language bindings</h3>

<p>
  Historically, the GNOME project has chosen the C language to develop its
  libraries, because it's easier to implement language bindings: to be able to
  use these libraries from other languages.
</p>
<p>
  The GObject library, at the heart of GNOME, has been implemented with
  language bindings in mind. When writing C/GObject code, it requires extra
  work to the developer because of language bindings. With the advantage that
  after that, the library is automatically usable from a wide range of
  languages thanks to GObject Introspection.
</p>
<p>
  So, that is the strategy used by GNOME and GTK to provide an attractive
  development platform for application developers: the latters can ideally use
  their favorite language to develop an application.
</p>

<h3>An attractive platform for <em>application</em> developers</h3>

<p>
  So I've talked about <em>one</em> advantage of the GNOME development platform
  for application developers: language bindings.
</p>
<p>
  But it's not enough in order to provide an attractive development platform.
  To be able to write new applications quickly, conveniently, and with enough
  flexibility, you need high-level, domain-specific libraries, with still an
  access to lower-level APIs when the need arises.
</p>
<p>
  And this is where GNOME could be much improved! Providing high-level APIs for
  various kinds of application domains. You don't like that new UI trend? No
  problem, you can just fork the application, and assemble the UI with
  different widgets. You want to create a specialized application (in contrast
  to the general-purpose one that GNOME provides)? No problem, use this
  framework and configure it that way.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, with an attractive development platform, it's possible to
  <em>easily</em> create different, but similar, applications in the same
  domain. Or, in short, a <em>software product line</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Example in a field that I know well, text editors:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First choice to make:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Either a general-purpose text editor: can be used for different CS languages.</li>
    <li>Or a specialized text editor: targets a specific CS language or platform.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Second choice to make:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Either a traditional UI.</li>
    <li>Or a smartphone-like UI.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  The two choices are orthogonal. With a software product line, it would be
  possible to have the four combinations. With each application having a small
  amount of code.
</p>
<p>
  (It would also put an end to the endless discussions and disagreements about
  which UI is best, just create one application with the desires of the
  designers, and if a developer disagrees, he or she can create another
  application. With code written as a library, and a small codebase for the
  application, this is doable).
</p>

<h3>But is C/GObject an attractive platform for <em>library</em> developers?</h3>

<p>
  The conclusion of the previous section is that most of the code should be
  written in a library fashion. Like the LLVM project does. This prevents
  reinventing the wheel, and enables new low-hanging fruits. Another name for
  this is "re-targettable code": you can leverage the codebase for new
  purposes, as the needs arise and as requirements change.
</p>
<p>
  But for GNOME, writing almost all the code in C/GObject is, well, how to say
  it, a little cumbersome. The C language is not memory-safe, C/GObject is hard
  to learn and not used by a lot of developers in the world.
</p>

<h3>Nanoprocesses, a solution</h3>

<p>
  Back to the WebAssembly and the Bytecode Alliance topic.
</p>
<p>
  With the concept of nanoprocesses applied to a desktop application, this
  would bring the benefit of being able to write <em>libraries</em> in various
  languages other than C, while still having good performances (in contrast to
  using a more heavyweight IPC solution like D-Bus, which already permits to
  develop services in other languages, since the services run in their own OS
  processes).
</p>
<p>
  Inter-nanoprocess communication isn't much slower than regular function
  calls, as explained in the Mozilla article linked above. So the primary
  purpose of C/GObject (language bindings) would no longer be relevant.
</p>
<p>
  On a more personal note, I don't know well recent web technologies, but
  Mozilla's article about the Bytecode Alliance has convinced me. I'm also
  convinced that I don't want to develop primarily in C/GObject for at least
  the next decade. I <em>have</em> heavily developed in C/GObject since 2012 or
  so, during at least 6 years, and then less heavily with ups and downs. With
  as focus during these years to make more code re-usable (which means,
  creating new libraries, with higher-level APIs, and losing a few feathers in
  passing). And, no, sometimes I don't have the same opinion as most other
  GNOME developers or designers. But I know that I did <em>good</em> work, I
  was going in the right direction architecture-wise, I have received many
  thank-you emails from users over the years.
</p>
<p>
  This article outlines potential <em>solutions</em>, <em>actionable</em>
  things. To stay relevant compared to web applications, the cloud, etc.
  Because, I still prefer "normal", desktop applications for which I own my
  data, is privacy-respecting, without ads, etc etc ;-)
